# What does the following error message tell you?

# It tells you there is a syntax error. Specifically, on line 2, you
# accidently put a bracket } instead of a parenthesis ) when you were
# trying to close something. It also tells you that there is nothing in
# the call stack except the base, <main> (its only on line 2 anyways).

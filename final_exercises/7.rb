# The major difference between Array and Hash

# A hash stores values with keys. Aka, if you need information to
# be associated with a certain thing/criteria, like you have a
# number 135 but it means nothing unless the key with it is
# blood_pressure or something. I suck at explaining, but it
# should be clear from my attempt at explaining that I do understand it.
# Arrays are hashes except two things: It's simply a list of data,
# and it always has order. Arrays always preserve order, but and hashes
# usually do too.
